## What Platform Engineering means to us

Below is a sample of quotes of what PE means to members of Cohort 4 at Capgemini

## Nawal

"Platform engineering is an approach that involves both technical and non-technical skills brought together to build, maintain and provide a working platform experience."

## Abdullah

"Platform Engineering is building a platform that serves as a foundation for other engineering teams building products and systems on top of it for end users."

## Clive

#### Initially
 
"As a sysadmin, I was hoping that platform engineering was going to be a direct substitution of  
responsibility for a physical server to one that is in the cloud. I wanted it to be 'Terraform will

layout the hardware' _in a virtual format_ and then the application teams will install their  

applications on that. I suppose that is the IaaS model but I should learn about the PaaS and SaaS  

models too."

#### Now
 
"I'm going go have to look at all the frameworks that exists (or at least understand am overview or

just that they exist) and discover the wonders of containers (similar to Solaris zones from 20 years ago)

with Kubernetes, Redshift and other CI/CD pipelines."

## Serkan

"Platform Engineering is about designing, building, and maintaining reliable, secure, efficient and cost-effective platforms (Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualisation, O/S, Middleware, and Runtime) so that application teams/developers can build on top of it. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) plays an important part in it to configure the infrastructure faster while reducing the chances for error. And do automation as possible to make the processes reliable and fast."

## Rob R

"Platform Engineering to me means being part of a collaborative team containing an infrastructure team, a software engineering team, and a Dev-ops team.  The goal of this team is to enable application developers to dekliver value to their clients end users in a faster, more reliable and easier manner"
